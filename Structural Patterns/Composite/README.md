### Composite 
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite let clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly
In simple words, we can say that the composite pattern composes the objects in terms of a tree structure to represent part as well as a whole hierarchy. The composite design pattern is used when we need to treat a group of objects in a similar way as a single object.

## When do we need to use the Composite Design Pattern in C# Real-Time Applications?
* We want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
* We want the clients to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.
