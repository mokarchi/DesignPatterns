### Flyweight 
The Flyweight Design Pattern is used when there is a need to create a large number of objects of almost similar nature. A large number of objects consumes a large amount of memory and the Flyweight design pattern provides a solution for reducing the load on memory by sharing objects.---


## When to use the Flyweight Design Pattern in C# Real-Time application?
* Many similar objects are used and the storage cost is high.
* The majority of each object’s state data can be made extrinsic.
* A few shared objects would easily replace many unshared objects.
* The identity of each object does not matter.
