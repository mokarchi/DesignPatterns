### Adapter 
The Adapter Design Pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This design pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for communication between two independent or incompatible interfaces. So, in simple words, we can say that the Adapter Pattern helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. If this is not clear at the moment then donâ€™t worry we will understand this with an example.
