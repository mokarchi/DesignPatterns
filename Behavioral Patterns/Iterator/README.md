### Iterator  
The Iterator Design Pattern in C# allows sequential access of elements without exposing the inside logic. That means using the Iterator Design Pattern we can access the elements of a collection object in a sequential manner without any need to know its internal representations.

The Iterator Design Pattern in C# allows us to Access the elements of a collection without exposing its internal data structure. That means it allows you to navigate through a different collection of data using a common interface without knowing about their underlying implementation.
