### Chain of Responsibility  
In simple words, we can say that the chain of responsibility design pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a given request. In this design pattern, normally each receiver contains a reference to another receiver. If one receiver cannot handle the request then it passes the same request to the next receiver and so on. One receiver handles the request in the chain or one or more receivers handle the request
