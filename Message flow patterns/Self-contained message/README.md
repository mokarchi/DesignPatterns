“Each message will contain all information needed to process a request as well as to understand its response.”

When sending a request, you need to remember what you want to do with the response that will eventually come back. In other words, you need to manage the state of the larger operation that this exchange is a part of while the request and response travel between components. This state management can be done entirely by the requester—storing contextual information—or it can be pushed out of it by having the entire context travel with the request and response across the network. In practice, this responsibility is usually shared, leaving part of the state in the requester and having part of it travel with the message. The point of this pattern is that you should strive to include sufficient information in the message so the state that is relevant to the current request is fully represented—removing and relocating relevant information should be considered a premature optimization until proven otherwise.
