“Include a return address in the message to receive a response.”

This is the most basic interaction pattern we know; it is the foundational building block for all natural communication, deeply ingrained in human training. A parent will say something to their infant child, who will initially gesture or make some sounds in response; later, the child will articulate words and sentences. Request-response is the way you learn how to speak, and it underlies all sophisticated forms of communication that you develop later. Although the response can be nonverbal (in particular, facial expressions, but also the deliberate absence thereof), in most cases you require a response before successfully concluding a conversation. The response can be a piece of information that you asked for or an acknowledgment of receipt for a command that was given.

In all these cases, there is one commonality that you need to make explicit when translating this basic means of communication into a programming pattern: the process begins with two participants A and B, where A knows how to address B; when receiving requests, B will need to learn or deduce how to address A in order to send back a response.
