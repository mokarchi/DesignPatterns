“Protect services by breaking the connection to their users during prolonged failure conditions.”

In previous patterns, we discussed how to segregate a system into a hierarchy of components and subcomponents for the purpose of isolating responsibilities and encapsulating failure domains. This pattern describes how to safely connect different parts of the system so that failures do not spread uncontrollably across them. Its origin lies in electrical engineering: in order to protect electrical circuits from each other and introduce decoupled failure domains, a technique was established of breaking the connection when the transmitted power exceeds a given threshold.

Translated to a Reactive application, this means the flow of requests from one component to the next may be broken up deliberately when the recipient is overloaded or otherwise failing. Doing so serves two purposes: first, the recipient gets some breathing room to recover from possible load-induced failures; and second, the sender decides that requests will fail instead of wasting time with waiting for negative replies.
