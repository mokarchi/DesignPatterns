“Prefer a full component restart to internal failure handling.”

In chapter 7 of the book we discuss principled failure handling, noting that the internal recovery mechanisms of each component are limited because they are not sufficiently separated from the failing parts—everything within a component can be affected by a failure. This is especially true for hardware failures that take down the component as a whole, but it is also true for corrupted state that is the result of some programming error only observable in rare circumstances. For this reason, it is necessary to delegate failure handling to a supervisor instead of attempting to solve it within the component.

This principle is also called crash-only software: the idea is that transient but rare failures are often costly to diagnose and fix, making it preferable to recover a working system by rebooting parts of it. This hierarchical restart-based failure handling makes it possible to greatly simplify the failure model and at the same time leads to a more robust system that even has a chance to survive failures that were entirely unforeseen.
