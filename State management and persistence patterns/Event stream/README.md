“Publish the events emitted by a component so that the rest of the system can derive knowledge from them.”

The events that a component stores in its log represent the sum of all the knowledge it has ever possessed. This is a treasure trove for the rest of the system to delve into: although the shopping cart system is only interested in maintaining the current state of customer activity, other concerns are tangential to it, such as tracking the popularity of various products. This secondary concern does not need to be updated in a guaranteed fashion in real time; it does not matter if it lags behind the most current information by a few seconds (individual humans usually would not be able to notice even a delay of hours in this information). Therefore, it would be an unnecessary burden to have the shopping cart component provide this summary information, and it would also violate the Simple Component pattern by introducing a second responsibility.
