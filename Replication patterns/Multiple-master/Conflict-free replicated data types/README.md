“Keep multiple copies of a service running in different locations, accept modifications everywhere, and disseminate all modifications among them.”

In the previous pattern, you achieved perfect availability of the batch service’s storage component—where perfect means “it works as long as one replica is reachable”—at the cost of either losing updates or having to care about manual conflict resolution. You can improve on this even further, but unfortunately at another cost: it is not possible to avoid conflicts while maintaining perfect availability without restricting the data types that can be expressed.
