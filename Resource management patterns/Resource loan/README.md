“Give a client exclusive transient access to a scarce resource without transferring ownership.”

A variant of the Resource Loan pattern is widely used in non-Reactive systems, the most prominent example being that of a database connection pool. Database access is represented by a connection object via which arbitrary operations can be performed. The creation of connections is expensive, and their number is limited; therefore, a connection is not owned by client code but is taken from a pool before performing an operation and put back afterward. The connection pool is responsible for managing the lifecycle of its connections, and client code obtains temporary permission to use them. Failures in this scenario are communicated to the client, but their effect on the connection in question is handled by the pool—the pool owns and supervises the connections.

In a Reactive system, you strive to minimize contention as well as the need for coordination: hence, the classic database connection pool usually only features as an internal implementation detail of a component whose data storage is realized by means of a relational database. But you will frequently encounter the use of scarce resources in your systems, and the same philosophy that drives the connection pool abstraction is useful in Reactive system design as well.
