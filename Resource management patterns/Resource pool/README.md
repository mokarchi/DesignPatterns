“Hide an elastic pool of resources behind their owner.”

So far, we have discussed the modeling and operation of a single resource as well as its interaction with its clients. The astute reader will have noticed that something is missing from the full picture: the core principles of Reactive system design demand replication. Recalling the discussion from chapter 2, you know that resilience cannot be achieved without distributing the solution across all failure axes—software, hardware, human—and you know that elasticity requires the ability to distribute the processing load across a number of resources that are dynamically adjusted to the incoming demand.

In chapter 13, you learned about different ways to replicate a component. The effort put into this mechanism depends greatly on how much the component’s state needs to be synchronized between replicas. This pattern focuses on the management and external presentation of the replicas. In keeping with the reasoning presented in chapters 4 and 5, it relies heavily on asynchronous message passing and location transparency to achieve scalability.
