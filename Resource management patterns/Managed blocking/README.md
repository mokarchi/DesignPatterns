“Blocking a resource requires consideration and ownership.”

In the example code for how the execution component in the batch job service provisions new worker nodes, you have already encountered the situation that an API you are using is designed to block its calling thread. In the case of the AWS API, there are ways around that, but this is not always the case. Many libraries or frameworks that you may want to or have to use do not offer the option of event-driven interaction. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)  is a well-known example that comes to mind. In order to use these APIs in a Reactive system component, you need to take special care to properly manage the resources that are implicitly seized, most notably the threads required for their execution.
