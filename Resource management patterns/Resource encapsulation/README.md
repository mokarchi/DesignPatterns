“A resource and its lifecycle are responsibilities that must be owned by one component.”

From the Simple Component pattern, you know that every component does only one thing, but does it in full; in other words, each component is fully responsible for the functionality it provides to the rest of the system. If we regard that functionality as a resource that is used by other components—inside or outside the system—then it is clear that resource, responsibility, and component exactly coincide. These three terms all denote the same boundary: in this view, resource encapsulation and the single responsibility principle are the same. The same reasoning can be applied when considering other resources, in particular those used to provide a component’s function. These are not implemented but merely are managed or represented: the essence of the Resource Encapsulation pattern is that you must identify that component into whose responsibility each resource falls, and place it there. The resource becomes part of that component’s responsibility. Sometimes this will lead you to identify the management of an external resource as a notable responsibility that needs to be broken out into its own simple component.
