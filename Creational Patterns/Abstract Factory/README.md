### Abstract Factory
    Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    The Abstract Factory Pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
    The abstract factory design pattern is merely an extension to the factory method pattern or factory pattern, which allows you to create objects without being concerned about the actual class of the object being created.
    Abstract means hiding some information and factory means which produces the products and pattern means a design. So, the Abstract Factory Pattern is a software design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme.
