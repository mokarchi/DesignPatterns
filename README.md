## Behavioral Patterns

### Memento
Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

### State
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

### Iterator
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

### Strategy
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
