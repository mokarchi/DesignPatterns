# DesignPatterns
Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems
# Types of Design Patterns
 
* [Creational patterns]
* [Structural patterns]
* [Behavioral patterns]
  * [Memento](#memento)
  * [State](#State)
  * [Iterator](#iterator)
  

## Memento
Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

## State
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
