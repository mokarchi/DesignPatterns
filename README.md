# DesignPatterns
Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems
# Types of Design Patterns
 
* [Creational patterns]
* [Structural patterns]
* [Behavioral patterns]
  * [Memento](#memento)
  * [State](#state)
  * [Iterator](#iterator)
  * [Strategy](#strategy)
  

## Memento
Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

## State
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## Iterator
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

## Strategy
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
